# ObservableObject

The [ObservableObject](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.toolkit.mvvm.componentmodel.ObservableObject) is a base class for objects that are observable by implementing the [INotifyPropertyChanged](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanged) and [INotifyPropertyChanging](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanging) interfaces. It can be used as a starting point for all kinds of objects that need to support property change notifications.

## How it works

`ObservableObject` has the following main features:

- It provides a base implementation for `INotifyPropertyChanged` and `INotifyPropertyChanging`, exposing the `PropertyChanged` and `PropertyChanging` events.
- It provides a series of `SetProperty` methods that can be used to easily set property values from types inheriting from `ObservableObject`, and to automatically raise the appropriate events.
- It provides the `SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion` method, which is analogous to `SetProperty` but with the ability to set `Task` properties and raise the notification events automatically when the assigned tasks are completed.
- It exposes the `OnPropertyChanged` and `OnPropertyChanging` methods, which can be overridden in derived types to customize how the notification events are raised.

## Simple property

Here's an example of how to implement notification support to a custom property:

```csharp
public class User : ObservableObject
{
    private string name;

    public string Name
    {
        get => name;
        set => SetProperty(ref name, value);
    }
}
```

The provided `SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string)` method checks the current value of the property, and updates it if different, and then also raises the relevant events automatically. The property name is automatically captured through the use of the `[CallerMemberName]` attribute, so there's no need to manually specify which property is being updated.

## Wrapping a non-observable model

A common scenario, for instance, when working with database items, is to create a wrapping "bindable" model that relays properties of the database model, and raises the property changed notifications when needed. This is also needed when wanting to inject notification support to models, that don't implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface. `ObservableObject` provides a dedicated method to make this process simpler. For the following example, `User` is a model directly mapping a database table, without inheriting from `ObservableObject`:

```csharp
public class ObservableUser : ObservableObject
{
    private readonly User user;

    public ObservableUser(User user) => this.user = user;

    public string Name
    {
        get => user.Name;
        set => SetProperty(() => user.Name, value);
    }
}
```

The `SetProperty<T>(Expression<Func<T>>, T, string)` method makes creating these wrapping properties extremely simple, as it takes care of both retrieving and setting the target properties while providing an extremely compact API.

## Handling `Task<T>` properties

If a property is a `Task` it's necessary to also raise the notification event once the task completes, so that bindings are updated at the right time. eg. to display a loading indicator or other status info on the operation represented by the task. `ObservableObject` has an API for this scenario:

```csharp
public class MyModel : ObservableObject
{
    private Task<int> requestTask;

    public Task<int> RequestTask
    {
        get => requestTask;
        set => SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion(ref requestTask, () => requestTask, value);
    }

    public void RequestValue()
    {
        RequestTask = WebService.LoadMyValueAsync();
    }
}
```

Here the `SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion<TTask>(ref TTask, Expression<Func<TTask>>, TTask, string)` method will take care of updating the target field, monitoring the new task, if present, and raising the notification event when that task completes. This way, it's possible to just bind to a task property and to be notified when its status changes.
