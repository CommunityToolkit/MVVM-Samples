# AsyncRelayCommand and AsyncRelayCommand&lt;T>

The [AsyncRelayCommand](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.toolkit.mvvm.input.AsyncRelayCommand) and [AsyncRelayCommand<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.toolkit.mvvm.input.AsyncRelayCommand-1) are `ICommand` implementations that extend the functionalities offered by `RelayCommand`, with support for asynchronous operations.

## How they work

`AsyncRelayCommand` and `AsyncRelayCommand<T>` have the following main features:

- They extend the functionalities of the non-asynchronous commands included in the library, with support for `Task`-returning delegates.
- They expose an `ExecutionTask` property that can be used to monitor the progress of a pending operation, and an `IsRunning` that can be used to check when an operation completes. This is particularly useful to bind a command to UI elements such as loading indicators.
- They implement the `IAsyncRelayCommand` and `IAsyncRelayCommand<T>` interfaces, which means that viewmodel can easily expose commands using these to reduce the tight coupling between types. For instance, this makes it easier to replace a command with a custom implementation exposing the same public API surface, if needed.

## Working with asynchronous commands

Let's imagine a scenario similar to the one described in the `RelayCommand` sample, but a command executing an asynchronous operation:

```csharp
public class MyViewModel : ObservableObject
{
    public MyViewModel()
    {
        DownloadTextCommand = new AsyncRelayCommand(DownloadText);
    }

    public IAsyncRelayCommand DownloadTextCommand { get; }

    private Task<string> DownloadText()
    {
        return WebService.LoadMyTextAsync();
    }
}
```

With the related UI code:

```xml
<Page
    x:Class="MyApp.Views.MyPage"
    xmlns:viewModels="using:MyApp.ViewModels">
    <Page.DataContext>
        <viewModels:MyViewModel x:Name="ViewModel"/>
    </Page.DataContext>

    <StackPanel Spacing="8">
        <TextBlock>
            <Run Text="Task status:"/>
            <Run Text="{x:Bind ViewModel.DownloadTextCommand.ExecutionTask.Status, Mode=OneWay}"/>
            <LineBreak/>
            <Run Text="Result:"/>
            <Run
                xmlns:ex="using:Microsoft.Toolkit.Extensions"
                Text="{x:Bind ex:TaskExtensions.GetResultOrDefault(ViewModel.DownloadTextCommand.ExecutionTask), Mode=OneWay}"/>
        </TextBlock>
        <Button
            Content="Click me!"
            Command="{x:Bind ViewModel.DownloadTextCommand}"/>
        <ProgressRing IsActive="{x:Bind ViewModel.DownloadTextCommand.IsRunning, Mode=OneWay}"/>
    </StackPanel>
</Page>
```

Upon clicking the `Button`, the command is invoked, and the `ExecutionTask` updated. When the operation completes, the property raises a notification which is reflected in the UI. In this case, both the task status and the current result of the task are displayed. Note that to show the result of the task, it is necessary to use the `TaskExtensions.GetResultOrDefault` method - this provides access to the result of a task that has not yet completed without blocking the thread (and possibly causing a deadlock).
