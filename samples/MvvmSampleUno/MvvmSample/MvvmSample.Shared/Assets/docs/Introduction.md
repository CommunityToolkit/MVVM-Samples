# Introduction to the MVVM package

The `Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm` package is a modern, fast, and modular MVVM library. It is part of the Windows Community Toolkit and is built around the following principles:

- **Platform and Runtime Independent** - **.NET Standard 2.0** ðŸš€ (UI Framework Agnostic)
- **Simple to pick-up and use** - No strict requirements on Application structure or coding-paradigms (outside of 'MVVM'ness), i.e., flexible usage.
- **Ã€ la carte** - Freedom to choose which components to use.
- **Reference Implementation** - Lean and performant, providing implementations for interfaces that are included in the Base Class Library, but lack concrete types to use them directly.

This package targets .NET Standard so it can be used on any app platform: UWP, WinForms, WPF, Xamarin, Uno, and more; and on any runtime: .NET Native, .NET Core, .NET Framework, or Mono. It runs on all of them. The API surface is identical in all cases, making it perfect for building shared libraries.

To install the package from within Visual Studio:

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. Search for **Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm** and install it.

2. Add a using or Imports directive to use the new APIs:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm;
```

```vb
Imports Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm
```

## When should I use this package?

Use this package for access to a collection of standard, self-contained, lightweight types that provide a starting implementation for building modern apps using the MVVM pattern. These types alone are usually enough for many users to build apps without needing additional external references.

The included types are:

- **Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm.ComponentModel**
  - `ObservableObject`
  - `ObservableRecipient`
- **Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm.DependencyInjection**
  - `Ioc`
- **Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm.Input**
  - `RelayCommand`
  - `RelayCommand<T>`
  - `AsyncRelayCommand`
  - `AsyncRelayCommand<T>`
  - `IRelayCommand`
  - `IRelayCommand<in T>`
  - `IAsyncRelayCommand`
  - `IAsyncRelayCommand<in T>`
- **Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm.Messaging**
  - `Messenger`
  - `IMessenger`
- **Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm.Messaging.Messages**
  - `PropertyChangedMessage<T>`
  - `RequestMessage<T>`
  - `AsyncRequestMessage<T>`
  - `CollectionRequestMessage<T>`
  - `AsyncCollectionRequestMessage<T>`
  - `ValueChangedMessage<T>`

This package aims to offer as much flexibility as possible, so developers are free to choose which components to use.  All types are loosely-coupled, so that it's only necessary to include what you use. There is no requirement to go "all-in" with a specific series of all-encompassing APIs, nor is there a set of mandatory patterns that need to be followed when building apps using these helpers. Combine these building blocks in a way that best fits your needs.

Code samples are available in the other docs pages for the MVVM package, and in the [unit tests](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/tree/master/UnitTests/UnitTests.Shared/Mvvm) for the project.
